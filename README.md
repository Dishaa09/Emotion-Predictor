# Emotion-Predictor

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Emotion Prediction using ResNet, a convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The model is trained to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset - the FER2013 containing facial images labeled with corresponding emotion categories. The dataset used for training, validation, and testing should be organized into appropriate directories.
